## 📁 File Structure

```
nexus-cli/
├── dist/
│   ├── nexus-cli/              # Folder distribution
│   │   ├── nexus-cli(.exe)     # Main executable
│   │   └── [dependencies]      # Required libraries
│   └── nexus-cli-standalone(.exe) # Single-file executable
├── run_nexus_cli.bat           # Windows launcher
├── run_nexus_cli.sh            # Unix/Linux/macOS launcher
├── demo_nexus_cli.py           # Interactive demo script
└── README_EXECUTABLE.md        # This file
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the executable doesn't start:
1. Make sure you're running it from the correct directory
2. Check that all files in `dist/nexus-cli/` are present
3. Try the standalone version instead
4. On macOS/Linux, ensure the file has execute permissions: `chmod +x dist/nexus-cli/nexus-cli`

### If you get "command not found" errors:
- Use the full path to the executable
- Make sure you're in the right directory
- Try running with `./` prefix on Unix systems

### For best experience:
- Run in a terminal/command prompt for full feature access
- Make sure your terminal supports colors and Unicode characters
- Use a modern terminal (Windows Terminal, iTerm2, etc.) for best display
