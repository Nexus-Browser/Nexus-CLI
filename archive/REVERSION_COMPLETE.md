# ✅ Nexus CLI Restored to Pre-Auth0 State

## What Was Removed

### 🗑️ **Deleted Files**
- `web/backend/auth.py` - Auth0 authentication module
- `web/frontend/auth.js` - Auth0 frontend manager  
- `AUTH0_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Auth0 setup documentation
- `AUTH0_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Integration summary
- `.env.example` - Environment template

### 🔧 **Code Changes**
- **`web/backend/main.py`**: Removed all Auth0 imports, routes, and dependencies
- **`web/frontend/index.html`**: Removed Auth0 SDK script and authentication UI components
- **`web/frontend/app.js`**: Removed Auth0 manager integration and auth headers
- **`web/frontend/style.css`**: Removed authentication-related styles

## ✅ Current Status

### **Fully Functional**
- ✅ Web terminal interface loads correctly
- ✅ All original functionality restored
- ✅ Warp-like styling intact
- ✅ No authentication dependencies
- ✅ Clean codebase without Auth0 references

### **Ready to Use**
- FastAPI server starts without errors
- All API endpoints work as before
- Terminal commands execute properly
- AI chat functionality available (with API quota)
- Code generation available
- Session management works

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Start the web interface
cd web/backend
python main.py

# Open your browser to:
http://localhost:8000
```

The web interface is now exactly as it was before we started adding Auth0 - clean, functional, and without any authentication overhead.

---
**Note**: The system is back to its original state with no authentication required. Users can access the terminal directly without any login process.
